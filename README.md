# Code-Assignment
## Problem statement
Please write a web service that takes in a string and returns a boolean to indicate 
whether a word is a pyramid word. A word is a ‘pyramid’ word if you can arrange the letters in increasing 
frequency, starting with 1 and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.
Examples:
banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's.
bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.
